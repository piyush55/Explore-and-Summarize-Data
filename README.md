# Explore and Summarize E-commerce Data with R
### Project 5 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
**Ioannis K Breier**




E-commerce is one of the fastest growing economic sectors worldwide. Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently hard to find among publicly available data.

However, The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011. The dataset is maintained on their site, where it can be found by the title “Online Retail”.

The dataset can also be found at Kaggle E-Commerce Data
 
In this project I use exploratory data analysis techiques in R to to identify meaningful relationships, patterns, or trends.
